# README

This is a web app I built for my interview for a Software Developer internship at Vancouver Community Network in the summer of 2017.
I used Ruby on Rails to build this app. This was the first time I have ever used Ruby on Rails.
This app is hosted on heroku at https://vcn-exam.herokuapp.com/users. Feel free to check it out!
