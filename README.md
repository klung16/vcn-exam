# README

This is a web app I built, using Ruby on Rails, as part of my interview for a Software Developer internship at Vancouver Community Network in the summer of 2017. This was my first time using Ruby on Rails


I was given the following four instructions:


1) Create a simple form that will ask for a name, email address, physical mailing address, and message. After submission, the form content will be saved in a database and displayed. 

2) Add validation to the form for the name and email address. 

3) Add Stripe to the form to receive payment.

4) Plot the physical mailing address on Google Maps.
